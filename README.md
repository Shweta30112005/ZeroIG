## Overview

Low-light images suffer from poor visibility, noise, and low contrast. Traditional methods are not adaptive, while deep learning methods require large paired datasets.

This project implements and extends **ZERO-IG**, a **zero-shot framework** that performs **joint denoising and enhancement** using illumination guidance. The model learns directly from a single image without requiring any training dataset.

## Key Idea

Based on **Retinex Theory**:

- Image = **Illumination × Reflection**
- Illumination → brightness (smooth)
- Reflection → details + noise

ZERO-IG jointly performs:
-  Denoising  
-  Enhancement  

---

##  Architecture

The model consists of three main components:

- **LD-Net (Denoise 1)** → Initial denoising  
- **IE-Net (Enhancer)** → Illumination estimation  
- **RD-Net (Denoise 2)** → Final denoising  

---

##  Our Contributions

We improved the baseline ZERO-IG model by:

- **Residual Blocks**
  - Better gradient flow  
  - Improved feature extraction

- **Channel Attention**
  - Focus on important features  
  - Better noise-detail separation  

- **Perceptual Loss**
  - Preserves textures and edges  
  - Improves visual quality
